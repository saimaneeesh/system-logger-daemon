This is a lightweight Linux system logger daemon written in C++ that:
- Runs in the background as a daemon process
- Logs CPU and memory usage every few seconds
- Writes logs to rotating log files in `logs/`
- Handles UNIX signals (pause, resume, terminate)
- Designed for middleware learning and system-level development
